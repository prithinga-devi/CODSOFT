<h1 style="text-align: center; align-item: center">ABOUT ME</h1><b><br>
<p class="capabilities">Hi, I'm Prithinga devi, a passionate software developer currently pursuing a BCA at Madras University. I have a strong interest in web development, with a focus on designing visually appealing and seamless websites to deliver an exceptional user experience. I enjoy creating websites and web applications that not only solve problems but also help individuals and businesses present themselves in a professional light.
  At present, I'm expanding my expertise in
  website development, specifically diving 
  deeper into frameworks like React. Along the 
  way, I've gained valuable insights into 
  website functionality and user-centric design.
  My technical skill set includes Python, SQL, 
  React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java, and 
  I'm always eager to explore new technologies 
  to enhance my problem-solving capabilities.
  I firmly believe in the power of self
  -development and continuous learning, which I 
  strive to apply in both my academic journey 
  and as a developer.Let’s connect! Feel free
  to reach out to me on [LinkedIn/GitHub/Email]

<h3>project 1</h3>
<p>This website is a cloned version of an existing IT solutions website, 
  recreated entirely without external assistance. It showcases various sections, 
  including company information, services, team details, and contact options. 
  The design follows a structured layout with a professional appearance, 
  featuring elements like interactive buttons, and a visually appealing format.
  it has not made responsive so i recommend to view it on laptop. Despite being a clone,
   it served as a great learning project, helping to understand web development concepts, HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactions.
   Further refinements can be made to enhance originality and functionality.</p>

<h3>project 2</h3>
<p> A half-finished chess game lay abandoned on a rickety table, a silent testament to the hours spent battling solitudeyou can get your costs down, build up a rainy day fund, and get to the point where you have some protection against failure before taking the plunge. Or your fear may be rooted in the idea of what other people will think. That’s a psychological fear which you can train your mind to overcome. Remind yourself that people often judge and criticise others as a twisted form of respect. They wish they had the courage to do what you are trying, and by criticising you they are deflecting from their own shortcomings. In those circumstances, your fear is simply a reflection of their own. Understand that, and it becomes much easier to set aside. Never let other people define what it means for you to succeed or fail. Don’t create an illusion of how you think others will react and allow this self-made prison to stop you pursuing your dream. When I am setting out on a major project or new business, I always ask myself the same question. Does the mission justify the risk? If I can satisfy myself that it does, then I know I can control my fears, and will accept any.</p>
